## 1 Project overview

### 1.1 Problem description

Language learners often struggle to find texts that match their proficiency level. A beginner (A1) might be overwhelmed by advanced (B2) texts, impeding learning progress. The ideal learning material should contain mostly familiar words, with a few new terms for gradual improvement.

### 1.2 Overall objective

This project aims to develop a predictive model for English speakers learning French, designed to assess the difficulty level of French written texts. The model will categorize texts according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) levels, ranging from A1 (beginner) to C2 (advanced).
